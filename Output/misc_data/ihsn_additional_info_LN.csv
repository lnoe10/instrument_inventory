Event/Transaction data [evn],Other Household Survey,"The main unit for data collection for transactions was the household. However, each income source and financial instrument was ascribed to a specific household member during the initial questionnaire. Thus all transactions associated with that instrument or income source are registered under its owner. Similarly, transactions related to expenses were individually attributed to the member who initiated the respective transaction. 

There was a small number of cash flows where the interviewer was not able to unambiguously identify the initiating household member. In these cases, the cash flow was recorded as belonging to the entire household (in the dataset the member ID field would be blank).

Analysis can be performed at two different levels of aggregation:
a) The household itself
b) Individual household members

In our study the household is defined as including those who consistently share financial resources, live together, share the same cooking arrangement, and report to the same household head. This includes babies, children, people who travel for work or school during the week and consider the household to be their main residence. However, the definition does not include people who are currently spending an extended period of time away from the household, including college students, students away at boarding school, military personnel, people in prison, or people who live in the house but maintain completely separate expenses (e.g. roommates, other families).","Once the villages for the Smallholder Diaries were selected, the research teams used a screening process to help identify a range of families with 5 acres of land or less, diverse income sources, access to agricultural inputs, wealth levels, and crops to participate in the research. 

In Mozambique, these eligible households were identified using a participatory rural appraisal wealth-ranking technique. Working with committees of village representatives, the research teams conducted wealth-ranking exercises to assess the relative wealth of households in village hamlets or subareas.",Yes,Household and expenditures,Household income/expenditure survey

The two targeting mechanisms (SCG and VFSG) were randomly assigned evenly between the 48 sub-counties, with the exception of the Karamoja region in which only the SCG targeting mechanism was employed. The SAGE programme implemented the targeting process in evaluation areas where selected recipients received the transfer, but only after they were surveyed at baseline by the evaluation teams.

The households in the evaluation areas that were selected for the programme are referred to as the treatment group. The comparison households that were selected were those households that fell just shy of the selection thresholds. For SCG the threshold is 65 years of age, dropping to 60 years of age in the Karamoja region. For VFSG eligibility depends on a household's labour capacity and dependency (LCD) score, with the threshold score for eligibility varying by region.

The two targeting mechanisms (SCG and VFSG) were randomly assigned evenly between the 48 sub-counties, with the exception of the Karamoja region in which only the SCG targeting mechanism was employed. The SAGE programme implemented the targeting process in evaluation areas where selected recipients received the transfer, but only after they were surveyed at baseline by the evaluation teams.

The households in the evaluation areas that were selected for the programme are referred to as the treatment group. The comparison households that were selected were those households that fell just shy of the selection thresholds. For SCG the threshold is 65 years of age, dropping to 60 years of age in the Karamoja region. For VFSG eligibility depends on a household's labour capacity and dependency (LCD) score, with the threshold score for eligibility varying by region. Households who fell just below the relevant SCG/VFSG threshold are referred to as the comparison group.",No,Impact evaluation,

Sample survey data [ssd],NA,"To better compare student performance internationally, PISA targets a specific age of students. PISA students are aged between 15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months at the time of the assessment, and have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. They can be enrolled in any type of institution, participate in full-time or part-time education, in academic or vocational programmes, and attend public or private schools or foreign schools within the country. Using this age across countries and over time allows PISA to compare consistently the knowledge and skills of individuals born in the same year who are still in school at age 15, despite the diversity of their education histories in and outside of school.","To provide valid estimates of student achievement, the sample of students had to be selected using established and professionally recognised principles of scientific sampling in a way that ensured representation of the full target population of 15-year-old students in the participating countries. 
Furthermore, quality standards had to be maintained with respect to (i) the coverage of the PISA international target population, (ii) accuracy and precision, and (iii) the school and student response rates. 

National Project Managers (NPMs) might have found it necessary to reduce their coverage of the target population by excluding, for instance, a small, remote geographical region due to inaccessibility, or a language group, possibly due to political, organisational or operational reasons, or special education needs students. Areas deemed to be part of a country (for the purpose of PISA), but which were not included for sampling, although this occurred infrequently, were designated as non-covered areas. Care was taken in this regard because, when such situations did occur, the national desired target population differed from the international desired target population. In an international survey in education, the types of exclusion must be defined consistently for all participating countries and the exclusion rates have to be limited. Indeed, if a significant proportion of students were excluded, this would mean that survey results would not be representative of the entire national school system. Thus, efforts were made to ensure that exclusions, if they were necessary, were minimised according to the PISA 2015 Technical Standards (see Appendix F of the Technical Report).",NA,,
